# PROJECT
Popular Movies, Stage 1

Build a simple movies app that communicates with the internet and provides a responsive user experience. In this project, you’ll fetch data from the Internet with the MovieDB API, use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views, and incorporate libraries to simplify your code.
